# Cryptography

> **Note**
> 
> Cryptography, or cryptology, is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. More generally, 
> cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects of
> information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern 
> cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, electrical engineering, communication science, and physics. 
> Applications of cryptography include electronic commerce, chip-based payment cards, digital currencies, computer passwords, and military communications.
